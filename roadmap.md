# OPOSSUM Project Roadmap

## Vision
OPOSSUM (Open-source PrOgrammable Smart System for Universal Measurements) aims to be a modular, battery-powered, open-source electronics testing platform. It will support automated, programmable diagnostics for a wide range of devices, using standard connectors, expansion modules, and an intuitive touch interface.

See [`to-do.md`](/docs/to-do.md) for details

## Phase 1 – Core Functionality (Q2 2025)
- [ ] Build initial hardware prototype
- [ ] Integrate SPI communication with Multimeter Click
- [ ] Implement relay control for input switching
- [ ] Develop basic touchscreen interface for manual test operation
- [ ] Add panel-mount fuses for input protection
- [ ] Define and document JSON test configuration structure

## Phase 2 – Automation & Expansion (Q3 2025)
- [ ] Add I2C expansion module support with proper initialization and power cycling
- [ ] Develop first signal-level switching expansion module
- [ ] Build system for automated test sequencing from config files
- [ ] Improve user interface for ease of test selection and data viewing

## Phase 3 – Hardware Refinement & Documentation (Q4 2025)
- [ ] Finalize enclosure design (battery compartment, touch display, port access)
- [ ] Optimize power management for battery-powered use
- [ ] Write detailed user manual and developer documentation
- [ ] Prepare demo videos and sample test scripts

## Phase 4 – Community & Stretch Features (2026+)
- [ ] Add Bluetooth/WiFi support for remote monitoring
- [ ] Develop PC-based visual test configuration editor
- [ ] Implement micro SD data logging and test result export
- [ ] Implement cloud-based logging and device syncing
- [ ] Explore AI/ML for anomaly detection during test sequences
- [ ] Encourage third-party expansion modules via open standards
