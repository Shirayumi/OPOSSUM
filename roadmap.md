# OPOSSUM Project Roadmap

## Vision
OPOSSUM (Open-source PrOgrammable Smart System for Universal Measurements) aims to be a modular, battery-powered, open-source electronics testing platform. It will support automated, programmable diagnostics for a wide range of devices, using standard connectors, expansion modules, and an intuitive touch interface.
